      <p>Progressive Enhancement is a web development approach focussing on the content of the website and builds the styling off the content. This method is important because it considers many possibilities that could prevent someone from being able to use a site. Basing the website on the content allows everyone access even if they are unable to access, say, JavaScript. It can also lead to easier maintenance.</p>

      <h2>Revision and Reflection</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>The project I chose for my final is making a website to sell items for a business. I designed it as if I was making a website for a business I could possibly make in the future. The original plan was to have a home page, three content pages, and a contact page. The 5 pages would all have the same header that changes name based on the tab, but has a navigation header at the top. All but the Contact page would have a navigation at the bottom that leads to the contact page as well as to the top of the page. The three content pages would look the same, each giving information on the type of content being sold.</p>

      <p>As I worked through this project, I encountered some hiccups. The first being the file system I had originally planned. I originally had folders for each page, but when I went to make the navigation, I was unable to connect to the indexes, so I had to pull them all out to be together in the main folder so they would work. Then, after I put the placeholder content in, I was looking at the CSS and realized that instead of having to copy and paste the CSS to each page, I could just section the CSS into a style sheet that affects all the pages rather than other style sheets that are specific to the individual pages.</p>

      <p>When working through this project, I really liked experimenting with looks and positioning using CSS. I also got to play around with JavaScript a bit. There were times I had to pivot because I couldn’t figure out positioning or I simply didn’t like the look, but the result I ended up with I quite liked. There were a few changes I made from my original.</p>

      <p>I was given feedback from a few people and the two main things I got was to get rid of the pink back blur and to put actual information in or longer placeholders to have actual information. I decided to go ahead and remove the pink backgrounds and make a combination of actual information and longer placeholders. I agree with what they wanted changed; it does look much better. I was also told that my Other page did not need a cost table as they are all so different. This made sense to me to change, so I took the table out from the page.</p>

      <p>For the course, I really liked learning web development. I think if I had taken more time to look up outside sources I would have gotten an even better understanding of the code structures and what I could do with the code. However, based on what I’ve learned in class, I really like the subject. I also took a database class while I was in this one where I had to connect a database to a front-end website, so I did get to experiment with different looks for different kinds of websites. If I had the chance in my future schedule, I would definitely take another class on this, and I will be looking at outside sources because the class did fascinate me.</p>
